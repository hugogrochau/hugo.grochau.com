This was a large school project spanning two different courses.

During the first course (Object Orientated Programming) I implemented the tabletop game of Risk in Java with Swing as the UI library. I used a mix of MVC, OOP and Observable patterns to structure the application.

In the second course (Programming Systems), the objective was to take our local game and make it capable of being played over a network with multiple machines.
