VoidMS was a MapleStory v62 private server I developed and ran between 2008-2012.

I forked an existing server implementation called OdinMS and developed bug fixes, new features and gamemodes with the help of my development team.

The server is written in Java and scripts (npcs, etc) are written in Javascript.

The server also had an official site and forum, which were administered by me and a team of community volunteers.

At its peak VoidMS had over 200 concurrent members and over 10.000 registered
