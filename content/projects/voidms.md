VoidMS was a MapleStory v62 private server I developed an ran between 2008-2012.

The server is written in java and scripts (npcs, etc) are written in javascript.

I forked an existing server implementation called OdinMS and developed bug fixes, new features and gamemodes with the help of my developement team.

The server also had an official site and forum, which were administrated by me and a team of community volunteers.

At its peak VoidMS had over 200 concurrent members and over 10.000 registered
