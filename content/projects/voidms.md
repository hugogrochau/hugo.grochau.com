VoidMS was a MapleStory (popular MMORPG) private server I developed and ran between 2008-2012.

I forked an existing server implementation called OdinMS and developed bug fixes, new features and gamemodes with the help of my development team (3 people).

The server is written in Java and scripts (npcs, etc) are written in Javascript.

The server also had an official site and forum, which were administered by me and a team of community volunteers (8-12 people).

At its peak VoidMS had over 200 concurrent players and 20.000 registered
